# Dali-Application Coding Sample 1 (DALI Data)

## 1) Video walkthrough (it is very long, I just run through each line of code):

## 2) How to run code locally:
You should download the R document (PlayingWithNetworks.R) and the csv (univcopy.csv) to your computer. I recommend opening the R code in RStudio (which makes everything having to do with R easy). You will need to download a few R packages if you don't already have them (which I note at the top of the document). You will also need to update your code to as to the path where you keep "univcopy.csv" so that you don't get an error on the read.csv(...) line at the beginning. Once all this is done, you can walk through the code one line at a time in RStudio and watch the magical data analysis and graphics that one can do in R.
