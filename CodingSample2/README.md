# Dali-Application Coding Sample 2 (DALI Data)
This is the project I made with 3 other Dartmouth students for the Dartmouth Hackathon 2023. We won 3rd place in the competition. Our product AcademIQ (pronounced "academic") is a Chrome extension that helps students have easier access to scholarly research on topics they already love.

## 2) How to run code locally:
You can easily get our Chrome Extension on your computer! Just follow these steps: 
1. Download the code in the AcademIQ repository (open up the Zip File it gives you)
2. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3. Switch on developer mode on the top right corner
4. Then click on "Load unpacked" on the top left corner and select the "AcademIQ-main" folder
5. Then just enable the AcademIQ Chrome extension as you would for any other Chrome extension as you use the browser
