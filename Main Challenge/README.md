# Dali-Application Main Challenge (Data)

## 1) Video walkthrough:

## 2) How to run code locally:
You should clone this repository and then run the html document (index.html) locally on your computer. I found it easiest to have all this code in VS code, and then to open index.html document using an extension in VS Code called "Live Server". This should allow you to locally see the graphs on your browser (for me, this worked on Google Chrome).


## More Code: 
I manipulated the courses csv given in the instructions on GitHub using Pandas on Google Colab. I then downloaded these cleaned up versions of classes data into the json documents that are in this repository. Below is a link to the Google Colab I used to work with the data (I also plot similar graphs to the ones here just for fun using Matplotlib): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BuV6Jyqz_d2r1ertq9vgB24GOANznsAD#scrollTo=u00tP0DgslXv
